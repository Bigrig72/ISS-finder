# PROJECT SCOPE

ISS FINDER

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

* As a user, I want to enter any location, so I can request where the ISS satellite is located.
* As a user, I want to know if the satellite is within my location's radius, so that I can view the satellite from my location.
* As a user, I want to know if the satellite is NOT within my location's radius, so that I know NOT to look for the satellite from my location.
* As a user, I want my search to populate dates and times if the satellite is not within my location's raduis, so that I know the next time the satiliate is within viewing range.
* As a user, I want the application to have a basic universe/satellite theme.
* As a developer, I want to utilize APIs to display the users request, so that accurate geo and ISS satellite informaiton is displays for the search results.
* As a developer, I want to create basic CSS and HTML files that have image placeholders for the JavaScript to render information.
* As a developer, I want to apply basic CSS styles to the HTML, so that the user has a visual idea of space.
* As a developer, I want create a search field, so that my user can search any location and get where the ISS satellite is at in real time.
* As a developer, I want I want to access the API keys to populate relevant informaiton to the location search, so that my user can use that information.
* As a developer, I want to create a server, so that I can use it to communicate with the API sources.

## Stretch Goals

* As a user, I want to get the weather from my search, so that I know how to dress appropiately.
* As a user, I want to see a basic animiation for the home page.
* As a user, I want to access a store API, so that I can see if telescopes are on sale.
